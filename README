About

This bot is a product of my desire to become more competent with C and Java, it
is not intended as anything more than a pet-project I am doing for my own 
personal enjoyment. If you find it useful or something, then use it. If you 
have any ideas or bug reports, please post them in the github tracker or send
me a pull request.

Originally I wanted to write this in strict C, but I found that Java is quite
nice for rapid prototyping, and I am finding it easier to create the bot in
Java. To this extent, I decided to write this bot in both Java and C.

Installation

*** WARNING ***: This project is NOT finished and may not have full or even 
basic  functionality.  These instructions are provided for anyone wishes to 
contribute to a developing project, not to use a functional bot. When this
project becomes stable, this warning will be removed on the stable, master 
branch. 

Use Ant to build the project and you should get a file called adrastea.jar in
the root directory. Move this file and config.sample.txt into a location of 
your choice. Rename config.sample.txt to config.txt. Ensure both the config and
the .jar are in the same directory. Edit the config file to your liking, and 
be sure to change the passphrase to something unique.

Next, Start up the bot with the following command:
java -jar adrastea.jar

I will be witting some scripts later to start up this bot as a service to allow
it to run independently after startup.
