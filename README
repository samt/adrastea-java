About

This IRC bot, written in C, was born out of my desire to achieve a degree of 
proficiency with the C programing language. Unfortunately, only an IRC bot was 
created. 

Version 1 was never released to the public and never will be. It is the only 
time where I have actually been ashamed of code I wrote. Instead, I am 
open-sourcing version 2 because I am interested in getting more practice in 
developing software with other languages and other platforms.

===============================================================================

Requirements

This BOT compiles with GCC and requires the GNU libraries to do so. As a 
result, it is for Linux only right now until I figure out how to make a cross-
platform program in C.

More information coming soon.
