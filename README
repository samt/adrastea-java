About

This bot is a product of my desire to become more competent with C and Java, it
is not intended as anything more than a pet-project I am doing for my own 
personal enjoyment. If you find it useful or something, then use it. If you 
have any ideas or bug reports, please post them in the github tracker or send
me a pull request.

Originally I wanted to write this in strict C, but I found that Java is quite
nice for rapid prototyping, and I am finding it easier to create the bot in
Java. To this extent, I decided to write this bot in both Java and C.
